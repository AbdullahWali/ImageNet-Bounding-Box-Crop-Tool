# ImageNet Bounding Box Crop Tool
This is a python script that automates cropping images from the ImageNet dataset using the bounding box annotations.
Image datasets downloaded from ImageNet often have bounding boxes around the object of interest. This script crops the images to that bounding box to improve object recognition

Note: This script does not work with images containing multiple bounding boxes
